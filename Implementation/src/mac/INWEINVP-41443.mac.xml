INWEINVP
 	#include COMSYS
 	; 
	; 19-Nov-2007 	PJones, Comment : it looks as though Shobby is resurrecting this 
	; routine for INWEINVP related events.
	; 
	; That's sensible, and in the long run we should move the code from INWEINVP1 
	; to either here or INStocktaking (whichever makes most sense) 
	; 
 	; 08-Nov-2007	shobby	Resurrected 
 	; 
	; The old version of this routine was deleted by PJones, October 10, 2007
	; (Backup copy in Sourcesafe if anyone's worried)
 
 	; The reason was that the whole thing had been copied and pasted to 
 	; INWEINVP1 which seems to contain newer versions of the INWEINVP code
 	; 
	; New stocktaking functionality is now also in INStocktaking
