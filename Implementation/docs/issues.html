<p>During the development of the development environment a number of issues has
 surfaced and had to be dealt with. Here is a list of issues that must be observed 
when updating any part of the tool chain in the environment: </p>

			<p>Routine that exports and imports NetManager artifacts</p>
			<p>Some auxiliary routines had to be created in the file WWWCOFAExportAndImport.mac to allow
			Cache classes to use parameters to access @NM import and export routines. These routines expect
			"global variables" (VORG) to exist, but that is not possible with classes. </p>
			<p>The developers must make sure that any change in the original routine signatures in 
				WWWCOFAExportAndImport.mac are reflected in the SC routines.

		<td>
			Cache's implementation use of the SAX parser. 
		<p>Cache wrongly strips the leading and trailing whitespaces of CDATA fields in XML. A hack was developed
	 to test for routine and implementation fields and,&nbsp;if the
initial character is not a label, add a space before anything.

I've tried all possible combinations of XML.TextReader and XML.Writer classes with
no success. Still I can't believe that Caché's XML implementaion can't be so flawed.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Update</b>: this was fixed by copying the source code and changing the way it initializes the parser. At
that moment, it now uses as parameter '1' to indicate that whitespaces must be preserved.

			Caché v5.0.20.6305.0

		<td>
			Cache's stability
			<p>
				Sometimes Cache will just accululate too many problems (maybe memory leaks?) and that may prevent
				the whole system from working. When Windows refuses to close a Studio Window or when it takes too
				long to do so, Studio maybe be with a problem. The required action is to restart Cache and possibly
				reboot Windows.
