<a name="cycle">
<h3>Working cycle for developers</h3>
</a>

</p><p>The ASDE working cycle can be repeated as many times as the developer wishes. It consists
	of going through the following steps (assuming the project is for CustomerX):</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Get new updates from the repository</b> - issue <i>bzr update</i> command and let Bazaar
		bring changes from the repository to the local project directory. You can be in any sub folder
		inside the project.
		<p>
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr update</b> <br />
		</blockcode>
		</p>

	</li>
	<li><b>Run ant to resolve conflicts, if there is any, and deploy changes</b> - run <i>ant</i>. If it finds conflicts,
		it will launch WinMerge for all of them. It will also compile and deploy all files to the correct places.
		Please remember that you must be in the <b>Implementation folder</b>.
		<p>
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main\Implementation&gt;<b>ant</b> <br />
		</blockcode>
		</p>
	</li>

	<li><b>Make changes</b> - make changes to Studio files, @NM artifacts, images, CSP files. Create
		new ones, rename or delete them. Work as usual.
	</li> <br />

	<li><b>Test changes</b> - test all your changes. Because you have updated work from the repository,
		there might be changes that affect your code. Make sure you test it.
	</li><br />

	<li><b>Add new files to source control</b> - <i>If</i> any new artifact was created during your working session,
		you must command bazaar to add it to version control. Just issue <i>bzr add</i> and all new files in the whole
		project tree directory will be added to source control (but remember&nbsp;they will be added to the shared
		repository&nbsp;only during the next step: commit).

		<p>
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main\Implementation&gt;<b>bzr add</b> <br />
		</blockcode>
		</p>

        <p>
        If you are not sure about which files should be added, issue the corresponding UI command <i>bzr qadd</i>
        so that you can visually check and confirm which files to add to the repository.
        </p>

	</li>
	<li><b>Commit changes to the repository</b> - If you have added any new files or changed anything, issue
		<i>bzr commit</i> (or <i>bzr commit -m "short description"</i> and the corresponding UI one <i>bzr
		qcommit</i>).If Bazaar notices that the repository has changed since your last update, it will tell
		you to update it again. So, update it again, test it again and try to commit again. To commit the changes, you can be in
		any sub folder inside the project directory.

		<p>
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main\Implementation&gt;<b>bzr commit</b> <br />
		</blockcode>
		</p>

	</li>

</ol>

<a name="browser">
	<h3>Browser connection to each namespace</h3>
</a>
<p>To access Alphalinc via browser, you have to build the URL using the chosen namespace, and
	the current IP or local name of the workstation. Suppose you have created three namespaces in your
	workstation, using the <a href="../installation/index.html#project">installation instructions</a>:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>alphalinccustomer1\main - main development branch for Alphalinc at Customer1
	</li>
	<li>alphalinccustomer1\prod_v1_64_1 - production branch for Alphalinc at Customer1
	</li>
	<li>alphalinccustomer2\main - main development branch for Alphalinc at Customer2
	</li>
	<li>alphalinccustomer2\prod_v1_65_16 - production branch for Alphalinc at Customer2
	</li>
</ol>

<p>You can access each by using the following URLs</p>
<ol>
	<li>http://machineNameOrIP/csp/AlphalincCustomer1Main/COMLogin.cls
	</li>
	<li>http://machineNameOrIP/csp/AlphalincCustomer1Prod_v1_64_1/COMLogin.cls
	</li>
	<li>http://machineNameOrIP/csp/AlphalincCustomer2Main/COMLogin.cls
	</li>
	<li>http://machineNameOrIP/csp/AlphalincCustomer2Prod_v1_65_16/COMLogin.cls
	</li>
</ol>

<p> Remember that each namespace is related to a project directory. Whenever you run
	ANT on that directory, an incremental deployment happens and affects <b>only</b> that
	namespace and related files. </p>

<a name="checkout">
	<h3>Checking out a branch</h3>
</a>

<p>When a developer wants to do the initial retrieval of a Bazaar
branch, he or she must perform a Bazaar checkout. Bazaar's checkout is
different from some other version control systems'. It doesn't lock any
files. It only means to make a initial copy from the repository to the
local workspace (a new folder in the local computer).
</p>

<p>Suppose there is an Alphalinc project that is being customized to CustomerX. The project has just
	started, a new shared repository (<i>customerx</i> ) was created on the machine <i>machine.address</i>
	and all files were sent to the <i>main</i> development	branch.
</p>

<p>To perform a checkout, the developer issues a <i>bzr checkout</i> command (to see a help text on that
	issue <i> bzr help checkout</i>). The checkout command can have two general forms:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>bzr checkout [from_url] [to_folder_name]</b> - The parameter <i>[from_url]</i> indicates wherethe shared
		repository is and the branch&nbsp;it must read from. The parameter <i>[to_folder_name]</i> indicates the name
		of the folder that will locally hold the files. If the folder does not exist, it will be created. This
		is the <b>preferred</b> way of checking out files for Alphalinc.
	</li>

	<li><b>bzr checkout [from_url]</b> - when the [to_folder_name] is not specified, Bazaar will try to guess
		the <i>[to_folder_name]</i> parameter from the last part of the <i>[from_url]</i>.
	</li>
</ol>

<p> For&nbsp;CustomerX's example above, the checkout command could be: </p><p>
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx&gt;<b>bzr checkout bzr://machine.address/customerx/main main</b> <br />
		</blockcode>

</p><p>This command will get an initial copy of all the files that are on the <i>main</i> development	branch,
	which is located inside the <i>customerx</i> shared repository, on the <i>machine.address</i> machine, using
	the <i>bzr://</i> protocol. A folder named <i>main</i> will be searched for within the folder
	<i>C:\Projects\customerx\</i>. If a folder named <i>C:\Projects\customerx\main</i> does not exist, it will be created.

<a name="update">
	<h3>Getting new changes from the repository (update command)</h3>
</a>

</p><p>Suppose a developer wants to get new updates for a project that he or she is working on. The developer,
	in this case, has already performed the files&nbsp;<a href="#checkout">initial checkout</a>. The
	developer must move to a desired directory and issue the following command (check additional options
	by issuing <i>bzr help update</i>):
</p>
<blockcode class="code">
	C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr update</b> <br />
</blockcode>

<a name="add">
	<h3>Moving new files under version control (add command)</h3>
</a>
<p>The developer must tell Bazaar that a new file should be put under version control.
	The <i>bzr add</i> command will add all new files in the project to the source control mechanism.
	The exception is those files that match any of the patterns in the <i>ignored list</i> (.bzrignored).
	There are already some patterns that are ignored. For example: *.tmp,*.bak,*.log,etc.
</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> make sure you <b>do not</b> create any kind of scratch or temporary file in the project directory, because when you issue <i>bzr add</i>,
it will be put under source control!
If you need to use scratch files, temporary files or user files of any
kind, move them under a directory called "TMP". This is automatically
ignored by Bazaar.</p>


<a name="commit">
	<h3>Sending new changes to the repository (commit command)</h3>
</a>

<p>Suppose developer wants to send new changes to the shared repository.  The
	developer must change to desired directory and issue the following command (check additional options
	by issuing <i>bzr help commit</i>):
</p>
<blockcode class="code">
	C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr commit</b> <br />
</blockcode>

<p>The system will prompt for a short description of the changes unless the other version is used:
</p>
<blockcode class="code">
	C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr commit -m "short description"</b> <br />
</blockcode>

<a name="tagging">
	<h3>Creating a new tag for the project version</h3>
</a>
<p>Whenever the development team reaches a milestone, or when any developer needs to put a mark
	on the project, a tag can be defined. Tags can be used later to help finding, comparing and
	working with different revisions. They also document the system. </p><p>

</p><p>It is good practice&nbsp;to create a tag just before a new branch is created, or when a bug fix
	is committed to production. To create a tag, just issue the command: <i>bzr tag name_of_tag</i>.
</p>


<a name="branching">
	<h3>Making a new branch from a project</h3>
</a>

<p>Let's suppose that the company has just finished some customizations for a new customer (customer X).
	That work has been done on the Bazaar branch <i>bzr://machine.address/customerx/main</i>
	(where <i>machine.address</i> is server's name or ip address, <i>customerx</i> is a
	Bazaar shared repository, and	<i>main</i> is a Bazaar <i>branch</i>).
	It is time to deploy the system to the customer. It is good practice to make a branch
	at this point so as to hold any fixes to that deployment version, while people continue to
	develop the main development branch. It is also suggested that a tag be created just before
	branching.
</p>

<p>The steps to be followed are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Test the system and make sure everything is fine for deployment;</li><br />
	<li>Create a new tag. For this example, we will use the name <i>prod-v1.0</i> (see the topic
		about <a href="#tagging">tags</a> for more information). <br />
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr tag prod-v1.0</b> <br />
		</blockcode>
	</li>

	<br />
	<li>Create a new branch. For this example, we will use the name <i>prod-v1.0</i>. This branch will contain all bug fixes that belong to that version. Issue the following
	command: <br />
	<blockcode class="code">
		C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr branch bzr://machine.address/customerx/main bzr://server/customerx/branches/prod-v1.0</b> <br />
	</blockcode>
	<p>This code creates a new branch called <i>prod-v1.0</i>. </p> When new bugfixes are needed in the production
	environment, developers can <a href="#checkout">checkout</a> this branch, make updates and commits.
	Whenever the bugfixing efforts are done with and the changes will be deployed to the production server,
	a tag should be created. In this case, it could be named <i>prod-v1.0a</i>
	(command: <i> bzr tag prod-v1.0a</i>).<p>
	</p><p>
		Once a bug has been fixed, it is a good idea to bring those changes back to the main development environment.
		This is called <a href="#merging">merging</a> the changes from one branch (prod-v1.0) into another branch
		(main).
	</p>
</li>
<br />
</ol>

<p>

<a name="merging">
	<h3>Merging changes from another branch</h3>
</a>

</p><p>The purpose of a merge is to get changes from one branch merged to another branch. To continue the example
	of <a href="#branching">branching</a>, the developer must now bring all the bug fixes from the branch
	<i>prod-v1.0</i> to the development branch <i>main</i>.
</p><p>

</p><p>This process is comprised of two steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Using the <b>merge</b> command to merge changes from the <i>prod-v1.0</i> branch to the
		<b>local folder</b> <i>customerx\main</i> (which holds the <i>main</i> branch files).
	<br />
	<blockcode class="code">
		C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr merge bzr://machine.address/customerx/prod-v1.0</b> <br />
	</blockcode> <br />
	The first time this command is used, it records the name of the branch the developer is merging from.
	So, the next use will be just <i>bzr merge</i> (look at <i>bzr help merge</i> for more details).
	</li>
	<br /><br />

	<li>Using the <b>commit</b> command to send the merged changes from the <b>local folder</b>
		<i>customerx\main</i> to the <i>main</i> branch in the <b>repository</b>.<br />
		<blockcode class="code">
			C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;<b>bzr commit -m "Bugfixes from prod"</b> <br />
		</blockcode> <br />
		This command is the regular commit command. The developer may also want to
		<a href="#tagging">create a tag</a> before committing.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="redeploy">
	<h3>Force a redeployment from the local file system</h3>
</a>
<p>Sometimes, because of power failures, system crashes or other unforeseen issues, you may suspect that
	the system is out of synch. If Alphalinc behaves in a weird manner, it might help to restart Caché. If it
	doesn't help, it might be a Windows problem, so you can try rebooting it. If all fails, you may try to
	force ANT to redeploy everything again, just like in the first time.</p>

<p>The directory <i>projectHome/Implementation/build/</i> (projectHome is where the current project is located) contains
	some files that are generated during an ANT run. Some of those files control the last time&nbsp;things were
	deployed to the file system and imported into Caché.
	</p><ul>
		<li>To force ANT to reimport everything into Caché, delete	the file
			<i>projectHome/Implementation/build/<b>last-updated.log</b></i>
	</li>

	<li>To force ANT to redo everything, including forcing a recompile of classes, script generation, string
		substitution, delete	the whole <i><b>projectHome/Implementation/build/</b></i> directory. Note that this is the situation
		the happens when ANT is run for the first time and the <i>user-config.properties</i> file has already
		been filled in with all the options.
	</li>

</ul>


<a name="source-control">
	<h3>Loading only source control files into Studio</h3>
</a>

<p>When migrating an existing namespace to use the ASDE tool, setting an initial load
	of the source control files will be needed. The following ANT command loads only the
Source Control files into Studio, overwriting them if they are already there:</p>

<p>
<blockcode class="code">
	C:\Projects\customerx\main\Implementation&gt;<b>ant load-source-control</b> <br />
</blockcode> <br />
</p>

<p>Note: be careful when issuing the full <i><b>ant load-source-control</b></i> command. Otherwise,
	<b>all files</b> will be loaded into studio.
</p>

<p>For complete migration instructions, please refer to the <a href="../overview/namespace-migration.html">
		ASDE migration document</a>.</p>

<a name="bzrcommands">
	<h3>Summary of common Bazaar commands</h3>
</a>

<p>There are two main interface modes to choose from when using Bazaar: </p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Command line interface</b> - this is the standard
interface referred to in throughout this documentation. Bzr commands
can be put inside scripts and shortcuts in order to make it easier to
repeat them. For example, the "bzr update" command could be put inside
a Desktop Shortcut to make it easier to update things often. <p>The see bzr help, issue <b>"bzr help"</b></p>

<blockcode class="code">
</blockcode><pre>C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;bzr help<br />Bazaar -- a free distributed version-control tool<br />http://bazaar-vcs.org/<br /><br />Basic commands:<br />  bzr init           makes this directory a versioned branch<br />  bzr branch         make a copy of another branch<br /><br />  bzr add            make files or directories versioned<br />  bzr ignore         ignore a file or pattern<br />  bzr mv             move or rename a versioned file<br /><br />  bzr status         summarize changes in working copy<br />  bzr diff           show detailed diffs<br /><br />  bzr merge          pull in changes from another branch<br />  bzr commit         save some or all changes<br />  bzr send           send changes via email<br /><br />  bzr log            show history of changes<br />  bzr check          validate storage<br /><br />  bzr help init      more help on e.g. init command<br />  bzr help commands  list all commands<br />  bzr help topics    list all help topics<br /></pre>
 <br />


	</li>

	<li><b>Graphical user interface</b> - when the TortoiseBZR option is installed, it makes
			it very easy to access most of Bazaar features in a intuitive way. The developer just
			opens Windows Explorer and chooses a project folder. Bzr will display context menus when objects are right-clicked on.

			<p>There is also another way of accessing bzr commands graphically. They are invoked by
				using the command line. They are those commands and options that start with "q"
				(also known as qbzr commands):
			</p>

<blockcode class="code">
</blockcode><pre>C:\Projects\customerx\main&gt;bzr help commands<br />(...)<br />qadd                 GUI for adding files or directories. [qbzr]<br />qannotate            Show the origin of each line in a file. [qbzr]<br />qbranch              Create a new copy of a branch. [qbzr]<br />qbrowse              Show inventory. [qbzr]<br />qcat                 View the contents of a file as of a given revision. [qbzr]<br />qcommit              GUI for committing revisions. [qbzr]<br />qconfig              Configure Bazaar. [qbzr]<br />qdiff                Show differences in working tree in a GUI window. [qbzr]<br />qgetnew              Creates a new working tree (either a checkout or full branch) [qbzr]<br />qgetupdates          Fetches external changes into the working tree [qbzr]<br />qinfo                 [qbzr]<br />qinit                Initializes a new (possibly shared) repository. [qbzr]<br />qlog                 Show log of a repository, branch, file, or directory in a Qt window. [qbzr]<br />qmerge               Perform a three-way merge. [qbzr]<br />qpull                Turn this branch into a mirror of another branch. [qbzr]<br />qpush                Update a mirror of this branch. [qbzr]<br />qrevert              Revert changes files. [qbzr]<br />qtag                 Edit tags. [qbzr]<br />(...)<br /></pre>
 <br />


<p>For example, to graphically find out the origin of a line in the file somefile.txt, just type
"bzr qannotate somefile.txt".
</p>

<p>Note: the "q" part in a name comes from the graphical library that is being used to draw
		the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The library is "Qt" (pronounced "Cute"). It is a portable
		library that runs on Windows, Windows mobile, Symbian (Cell phones), Linux, MacOSX and Java.
