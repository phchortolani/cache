	<h2>Alphalinc Software Development Environment -&nbsp;Implementation history </h2>

<p>The present document contains all major decisions made in the course
of the ASDE development. The goal is to provide developers with clues
as to why decisions were made. It also means to give developers
knowledge&nbsp;on&nbsp;previous attempts that have not proved
successful. However, attempts that have not worked as expected in the
past still work properly in the future, if only&nbsp;any new
information is made available.
</p>

<p>Please keep this list short, linking to other documents for suplemental information, if necessary.
	New entries go first. The date format should be: YYYY-Month-DD. You can also consult the
	<a href="developers.html">list of developers</a>.

		The method identifies the @NM artifact that should be saved. For exceptions and special cases, an appropriate

		<td>Developing. Importing files into Caché. Now, ant takes into consideration whether the artifact
			has a newer timestamp than the last time it was exported from Studio (if at all). So, to be imported into
			Caché, an artifact must: 1) be newer than the last-updated.log file; 2) If it is listed inside
			last-exported.log, the artifact timestamp must be newer than its timestamp that are in the
			last-exported.log. This change was needed to prevent ANT from re-importing things that were previously
			exported by Studio or @NM.

			Major change regarding what kind of object gets exported. Before this change, Caché classes and include
			files that were generated by @NM classes were not included. Later, some of those artifacts were
			included because of circular references found (User.COMQuickSearch.CLS is needed by @NM to compile other
			calsses, including User.COMQuickSearch.CLS itself). Now, it was decided that @NM generated classes
			should be kept under source control, because @NM doesn't completely override modifications made directly
			to it (for further info contact <a href="developers.html#andre">André</a>). So changes were made to the
			exclude list and the code in SourceControl.AlphalincBase.cls and SourceControl.Exporter.cls. Now the code
			doesn't test if a Caché class was generated by @NM anymore. Additionally, a new
			<a href="sourceControlHooks.html#nmcreate">hook</a> was placed in @NM,
			so that whenever a Caché class gets generated, it is also exported to the file system. All CompileNMClass
			calls were also removed from SouceControl.Importer.
