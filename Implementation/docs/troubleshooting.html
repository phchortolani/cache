<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

<p>This is a list of the most common problems that may occur. If you can't find your problem in the following list,
it may be a new one, so it should be added to the appropriate place. Search this list with Ctrl+F and the error
message you have read. Alternatively, browse by&nbsp;topic.
</p>

<a name="general">
<h3>General problems</h3>
</a>

<p>There is a global that can be used to prevent the system from exporting @NM artifacts. This is helpful on production
servers, where it is not interesting to run all tests that are fired from the source control hooks. If the global
 ^SourceControl("ignoreExport")=1 is set, the system skips @NM checks for exports.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, during system crashes or interruptions, the ant system might be left in an incomplete state.
 You may force <span style="font-style: italic;">ant</span> to redeploy part or all of its files by deleting the appropriate files from the <b><i>build</i></b>
folder. Ant will send a list of files to be imported to Caché. Ant's list is based on the timestamps of files.
 Any file that was modified after the log files are put in that list. Caché gets that list and compares it to the
 ^SourceControlTimeStamps(filename) global. The file is actually&nbsp;imported only &nbsp;when the timestamp is newer than
that in the global. To force the tools to reimport everything, you will need to erase the build folder and also kill
 the ^SourceControlTimeStamps global.

If there are no messages, try reaching the basic tomcat page by pointing the browser to http://localhost:8080.

You must create the user Jasper reports will be using in Caché's SQL
Manager. Take a look inside the JasperServlet.java file
to see which user and password&nbsp;will be needed. Remember to also
grant the user "jasper" the correct rights. In Caché's SQL manager,
execute the following query: <i>GRANT SELECT ON * TO JASPER<i>.

Error Error loading byte data : <nobr>http://localhost/Alphalinc/LogoSES.jpg</nobr>
</td>
<td>
The reports have been made by hardwiring the reference to this image inside them. While this issue does not get fixed, it is
necessary to create a virtual directory in ISS host with the name <i>Alphalinc</i> and place this image there. Another option is to
create a virtual directory in ISS host with the name <i>Alphalinc</i>,
and then point it to the resources folder (the required file is already
there). Update: we are changing the reports, one by one. Instead of
loading the image from <nobr>http://localhost/Alphalinc/LogoSES.jpg,</nobr> they will be loaded from the URL <i>$P{folder}+"LogoSES.jpg"</i> (you just have to add the parameter <i>folder</i> to the list of parameter definitions of the report).
