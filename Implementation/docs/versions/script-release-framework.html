<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

<p>This is a complete explanation of what the script release framework is and how should be used.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="description">
<h3>Description</h3>
</a>

<p>The script release framework was developed to make it possible to execute data changes,
define security settings or any other tasks that aren't managed natively by ASDE.
</p>

<p>For example, if you create a @net Manager class, it is interpreted by ASDE as metadata
information and it is automatically serialized to a physical file so that it can be versioned
and propagated to all environments through Bazaar. Occasionally, you may need to populate
the corresponding table for this class with initial data, as a domain table. If you insert
data on it, this information won't be serialized and propagated because it's not metadata.
But you still need to propagate it. The solution on these cases is to use the script release
framework.
</p>

<p>In the Alphalinc Core we have a table that is used to identify the current version of each
module. The most important version is from module "Alphalinc" =&gt; ^WWWVERSION(0,"AlphaLinc",1) .
What you need to do on the framework is create a specific script release for each of
the Alphalinc versions being developed. The script release is basically a Caché class that
extends from the <b>VAR.update.ScriptRelease</b> class. For example, if you are working on
Alphalinc version 1.62, you must create a class called <b>ScriptRelease01r62</b>. The package
where it is created depends on the repository you are using: if you are on an ASDE repository,
the corresponding package is <b>SourceControl.update</b>, in the core repository the package is
<b>IN.update</b>, and in customization repositories the package is <b>VAR.update</b>.
</p>

<p>The script release class represents a release version, for example 1.62. Each script
release class may have multiple methods, one for each build version, named UpdateBuildXXX,
where XXX represents the build number. For example, version 1.62.8 will be implemented on
method UpdateBuild008() from class ScriptRelease01r62. All data changes, configuration
settings and any other task to install the current version should be placed in the build
method.
</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>
</a>

<p>Here is a table describing a method that may be used during a build method:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Method
</th>
<th>Purpose
</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..GetCurrentVersion()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>This method should be used to get the current version number in string, expressed as
XX.YY.WWW, where XX represents the major release number, YY the minor release number and
WWW the build number.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..IncMajorRelease()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>This method should be used at the end of the method to increment
the major release number.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..IncMinorRelease()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>This method should be used at the end of the method to increment
the minor release number.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..IncBuild()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>This method should be used at the end of the method to increment
the build number.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..SetParameter(name, value)<br />
             ..GetParameter(name)</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>These methods should be used to record a named value for later use. For example, if
you want to run a script piece only once, you can use a flag to control this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if ('..GetParameter(flag)) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... // do something<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..SetParameter(flag, 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
<br />
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..SetAcceptanceTestComputers(names)</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>Method that should be used to set the computer names (comma separated) that are
used as acceptance test environments.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..IsAcceptanceTestComputer()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>Method that should be used to test if the current computer is one of the computers
previously defined as acceptance test environments.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..SetProductionComputers(names)</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>Method that should be used to set the computer names (comma separated) that are
used as production environments.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><nobr><i>..IsProductionComputer()</i></nobr>
</td>
<td>Method that should be used to test if the current computer is one of the computers
previously defined as production environments.

<h3>Example</h3>
</a>

<p><pre>
Import (VAR.update, SourceControl.control, SourceControl)

Include COMSYS

Class VAR.update.ScriptRelease01r62 Extends VAR.update.ScriptRelease [ ClassType = "", ProcedureBlock ]
{

Parameter PARAMFLAG As %String = "PARAM_FLAG";

Method UpdateBuild008() As %Status
{
	write !, "Current Version: ", ..GetCurrentVersion()

	do ..SetAcceptanceTestComputers("TESTSERVER")
	do ..SetProductionComputers("CLIENTSERVER")

	if (+..GetParameter(..#PARAMFLAG) = 0) {
		write !!, "Fixing data"
		set idCLASS = $order(^CLASS(0, ""))
		while ($length(idCLASS) > 0) {
			if ($data(^CLASS(0, idCLASS, 0, 1))) {
				write !, "Removing node ^CLASS(0, """_idCLASS_""", 0, 1) ..."
				kill ^CLASS(0, idCLASS, 0, 1)
			}

			set idCLASS = $order(^CLASS(0, idCLASS))
		}

		do $$$Save("CLASS", "REC1", "FLD11~FLD12", 1)
		do $$$Save("CLASS", "REC2", "FLD21~FLD22", 1)
		do $$$Save("CLASS", "REC3", "FLD31~FLD32", 1)

		do ..SetParameter(..#PARAMFLAG, 1)
		write !!, "Data fixed."
	}

	do Install^EmailService()

	if (..IsAcceptanceTestComputers() || ..IsProductionComputers()) {
		do Run^EmailService()
	}

	do ..IncBuild()

	quit $$$OK
}

}</pre>
</p>

<p>This example will be executed automatically via ASDE when you run the "ant" command and
your environment is on version 1.62.8. These are the steps it is implementing: set computer
environments, use a flag to decide if it fixes or not data, install a service and, if
it's running on an acceptance test or production environment, run the service. The last
line (do ..IncBuild()) is only included when the build or release is done. So, you need to
increment the version and the upgrader continues running at the next script. Not having
incremented the version means that this is the current release/build being developed. In that
case, every time you run the "ant" command, this script will be run. So, bear in mind that the
scripts can be executed more than once, so it should be prepared for it.
</p>

<p>If any error occurs, the script won't finish correctly and the version increments won't
be applied. Therefore, the script should be fixed and run again.
