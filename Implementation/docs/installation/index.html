<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

<p>The basic requirements to use the Alphalinc Software Development Environment are
	a good machine with plenty of hard disk space left and a processor capable of
	running Cache. Typically, the hard disk space available must be enough to fit Caché (including the
	server component), all the tools and all the namespaces needed. The faster the developer
	workstation, the lower the time spent waiting for files to be loaded and compiled.
</p>

<p>After installing Bazaar, it will be possible to host one or more shared repositories for source control.
	Since every developer will install Bazaar as part of the Alphalinc Software Development Environment,
	anyone can host shared repositories when appropriate.</p>

<p>This document is a guide for downloading, installing and configuring everything that is necessary
	to have a complete Alphalinc Software Development Environment. If you have not done so before,
please take a look at the <a href="../overview/index.html">overview</a>, to learn how all parts of
ADSE fit together. </p>

<a name="tools">
<h3>Software and tools installation</h3>
</a>

<p>These are the steps required to setup the environment. Please pay attention to the installation order because some
	components require others to be already installed. When available, the <i> install</i> link provides
	detailed step-by-step instructions for each item.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Install Operating System</b> - The system has been developed and tested on Windows and on Unix
		CentOS (~ Red Hat), but not fully tested.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install Bazaar</b> - Bazaar is the distributed version control system that the Alphalinc
		Development Environment uses. Open the following link for installation details:
		<a href="bazaar-installation.html">installation procedure</a>.
		Please, take a quick look at the
		<a href="../../../Requirement/ASDE/Bazaar%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">Bazaar Cheat Sheet</a>
		and the <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/Workflows">Bazaar Workflows</a>.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<a name="webserver">
		<b>Install Web Server</b> </a><a name="install-iss">-</a>
		If your O.S. is Windows, please, install Microsoft's Internet Information
		Services (IIS): <a href="../../../Deployment/ASDE/WebServer/roteiro-instalacao%20do%20iis.txt">installation
		procedure</a>. For Unix / Linux, install Apache (download it from
		<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">httpd.apache.org</a>).
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install Intersystems Caché v 5.0.21 / v 2008.2.3 / v 2008.2.6 or Ensemble 2008.2.0DS</b> -
		Perform a standard installation with 8-bit language (or Unicode for Ensemble). Copy the version you
		need from <a href="%5C%5Cloira%5CSoftwares%5CInterSystems">\\loira\Softwares\InterSystems</a> to your
		computer. After copying, just double click on the file and follow the instructions, answering <b>No</b>
		when it asks for license information. After installing it, you can copy the license needed from one
		of our servers (Bonita, Morena, etc.) running a similar version that you installed. The license is
		usually located in the directory [CACHE_ENSEMBLE_INSTALL]\Mgr\cache.key. Copy this file to your
		Caché / Ensemble installation directory (at the same location) and restart it.
		<b>Take note of the complete path of installation.</b>
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install 7-Zip</b> - 7-zip is a free graphical file archiver with greater compression ratio
		than ZIP or RAR. The program can also handle ZIP and RAR files. It is used by the <i>backup.cmd</i>
		script that the environment creates. Copy 7-zip from
		<a href="%5C%5Cloira%5CSoftwares%5CUtilit%E1rios%5CCompactadores">\\loira\Softwares\Utilitários\Compactadores\7z465.exe</a>
		(or download it from <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">www.7-zip.org</a>) to your computer. After
		copying it,&nbsp;double click on the file and follow the instructions.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install Java SE 6 Update 14 or higher</b> - This package includes&nbsp;Java Virtual Machine and
		the Java Software development kit. They are required by the Tomcat Servlet Container, the ANT
		tool, the compiler and the jasper Reports libraries. It can be downloaded from
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/?intcmp=1281">java.sun.com</a>. (the off-line
		installation version is preferred, because it is faster to complete the process, and if a reinstall
		is required the file has already been downloaded). Run these steps to install it:
		<a href="java-installation.html">installation procedure</a>.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install ANT v 1.7.1 or higher ant ant-contrib</b> - The Apache ANT tool is the main scripting
		tool for the environment. The Ant-Contrib project is a collection of tasks to enhance Apache Ant.
		Run these steps to install both at the same time: <a href="ant-installation.html">installation
		procedure</a>.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install Tomcat 5.5.x or Tomcat 6.0.x</b>	- The Apache Tomcat Servlet Container. Run these
		steps to install it: <a href="tomcat-installation.html">installation procedure</a>.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li><b>Install iReport</b> - iReport is a graphical report designer for Jasper Reports.
		It can be copied from
		<a href="%5C%5Cloira%5CSoftwares%5CDesenvolvimento%5CJava%5CiReport">\\loira\Softwares\Desenvolvimento\Java\iReport</a>
		(or download it from
		<a href="http://jasperforge.org/plugins/project/project_home.php?group_id=83">http://jasperforge.org</a>).
		This will be a Windows executable file (<i>iReport-2.0.3-windows-installer.exe</i> or
		<i>iReport-nb-3.5.2-windows-installer.exe</i>).
		Remember that projects using Caché 5 (e.g. SES-DF) should use an iReport 2 version, and
		projects using Caché 2008 or Ensemble (e.g. TCI and SESAU) should use an iReport 3 version.
		Double click on it and follow the instructions.	A good overview of how iReport and Jasper
		Reports work can be found at <a href="http://ireport.sourceforge.net/cap3.html">
		http://ireport.sourceforge.net/cap3.html</a>. The Jasper Report libraries are already in
		the Alphalinc source control repository, so you must <b>not</b> download them separately.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Install Winmerge</b> - Winmerge is a free graphical diff and merging tool for Windows.
		Run these steps to install it: <a href="winmerge-installation.html">installation procedure</a>.
		<br />&nbsp;
	</li>

	<li><a name="project">Finally</a>, follow the instructions for project and namespace configuration
		for every namespace&nbsp;you want to work with in your workstation.
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="project">
<h3>Project and namespace configuration</h3>
</a>

<p>A developer may work with as many namespaces as needed in his or her workstation&nbsp;. Each namespace is
	associated to a different project directory. All files from a particular namespace are stored in one
	particular directory. To make things more organized, it is suggested a standard <i>deployments</i>
	directory be created so that each <i>deployed</i> project is contained there. A deployed project is one that has
	all its relevant files deployed to the correct places (images, CSPs, htmls, MAC, CLS, etc).
</p>

<p>It may also be productive to work with more than one namespace for the same variation of the codebase.
	For example, a developer may have one project (and namespace) set to the DEV branch and another project
	(and associated namespace) set to the PRODUCTION branch.
</p>

<p>Please follow the steps bellow for <b>each</b> namespace that you want to work with. The only limit is
	the available RAM and disk space on the workstation. It is very important, however, to remember to use
	a <b>different name for each new namespace</b> (remember that the same name used for the namespace is
	also used for the project directory, deployment directory, virtual directories and URLs).
</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Create deployment directories</b> - these directories will hold all the deployed files that are
	    kept outside Caché database when Alphalinc runs. For the sake of organization, it is recommended to
	    create a base deployment directory for every project and keep all other subdirectories inside that.
	    However, the deployment directories can be anywhere as long as there is one deployment directory
	    (Resources, Csps, etc) for each project. Run these steps to configure it:
	    <a href="deployment-configuration.html">configuration procedure</a>.
	</li>

	<li><b>Configure the web server (IIS)</b> - two virtual directories will be added to the current
	    installed web server: one for CSP files and other for regular files (HTML, images, etc).
		This guide will use MS Internet Information Services (IIS) as an example. Run these steps to
		configure it: <a href="iis-configuration.html">configuration procedure</a>.
	</li>

	<li><b>Configure a new namespace in Caché</b> - Caché needs a few definitions to find the
	    resource, database and CSP files. Run these steps to configure it:
	    <a href="cache-configuration.html">configuration procedure</a>.
	</li>

	<li><b>Configure project</b> - in this step, a new project directory is created to hold <b>all</b>
	    files related to a namespace (but only to this namespace). From this directory, all files will be
	    synchronized with one or more repositories. They will be also imported into Caché, deployed to
	    the correct deployment directories that correspond to the locations of resources, CSPs, HTMLs,
	    JS, reports, etc. After it is created, the directory will be bound to a bazaar repository so
	    that contents can be synchronized the other way round. Run these steps to configure it:
		<a href="project-configuration.html">configuration procedure</a>.
	</li>

	<li><b>Edit the <i>user-config.properties</i> file</b>. Open the <i>projectDir/user-config.properties</i> file
		with Wordpad and fill in the properties. If you don't see the file, please review the last steps of the
		<a href="project-configuration.html">project configuration document</a>.
	</li>

	<li><b>Load the source control hooks into Studio</b> - this step differs depending on what will be done
		with this system. If you will use an already exported namespace (a namespace that was migrated to
		source control) you can just run <i>ANT</i> one more time and it will load all files into Caché.
		However, if you are migrating an existing Caché namespace to source control, <b>don't run ant again</b>
		because in this case you don't want to overwrite the existing namespace. For either case, see the
		document <a href="../overview/asde-use.html">ASDE use</a>.
	</li>

</ol>

<a name="use">
<h3>Using the tools</h3>
</a>

<p>Now that everything has been installed, you can start using the system.</p>

<p>Notice that some scenarios can cause the system to redeploy all files. This is a lengthy process.
	It can happen whenever one of the following situations occur:
	</p><ol>
		<li><i>ANT</i>
is run for the first time after installation (because there is no
"build/last-updated.log file"), just after updating all files from the
first time; </li><li>When the file <i>build/last-updated.log</i> is deleted <b>and</b> the global ^SourceControlTimeStamps is removed.</li>
	</ol>
