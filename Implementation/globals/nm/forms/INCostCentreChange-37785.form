001:<i><b>This form should be restricted to staff responsible for managing the General Ledger structure.</b></i><p /><hr /><p />Locations are defined in a hierarchy of Entities, Site Locations and Departments. Each of these three levels can have sub-levels.<p />These are defined under the menu path : <strong>AlphaLinc » System » Company Parameters » Edit Locations</strong><p />Each location can be associated with a single cost centre.<p />Cost centres are defined under the menu path : <strong>AlphaLinc » System » General Ledger Specifications » Edit Cost Centres</strong><p />A single top-level entity location will provide a default cost centre. This is inherited by all sub-locations unless a different cost centre is explicitly defined for a sub-location. All locations below that sub-location will then inherit the over-riding cost centre.<p />This form allows cost centres to be allocated to locations but does not update the information stored under General Ledger Parameters until the Update button is pressed.<p />When that occurs, each location being altered will have the changed details recorded in the General Ledger Parameters for the location and if any stock is held in that location, an adjusting transaction will be sent to the General Ledger to amend the Stock On Hand accounts if they are cost centre based. This may take some time and the update should be performed during a period with no or few stock transactions taking place in the locations being reassigned.<p />Subsequent stock transactions will provide the cost centre information to permit the appropriate accounts to be used when posting to the General Ledger. Transactions which update or use Weighted Average Cost will use the cost history for the particular cost centre associated with the location.<p /><hr /><p />The Location Hierarchy tree displayed below the form can be used as an alternative search method to populate the Location. The tree is opened or closed based on the current location specified in the Location field.  The position of the current location is identified by an open folder  <img alt="" src="\dev\oopen.gif" />  and by bold text.</p></p>Displayed are :<ul><li>The parents of the current location;</li><li>Those locations at the same level with any parent location;</li><li>Those locations at the same level with the current location; </li><li>The current location; and</li><li>Those locations immediately subordinate to the current location.</li></ul><p />A plus "+" indicates a location which has further sub-locations. If any of the sub-locations have been modified and are awaiting the update, the closed folder  <img alt="" src="\dev\oclose.gif" />  will be replaced by a black triangle.   <img alt="" src="\dev\scrright.gif" /><p />Existing cost centre assignments are displayed in <strong>RED</strong>.<p />If a sub-location has no entry it's existing cost centre is found by tracing back through the parent locations to see which cost centre is inherited.<p />If a location has had a new cost centre specified (including where the New Cost Centre field has been left blank), the new cost centre will be displayed in <strong>BLUE</strong>.<p /><p />To cancel an update request for a location, select the location and delete the record before the Update button is pressed.<p />If a cost centre change has been made incorrectly it is necessary to edit the location again and generate a further update. This may result in the merging of weighted average cost information between the two cost centres involved for each stock item where the level of stock on hand for the location is not zero.
