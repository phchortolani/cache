001:<br />AlphaLinc transactions passed for processing into the General Ledger may use an Account Identification Matrix to determine the appropriate account number.  This will require certain Posting Characteristics to be included with the record - These Characteristics may be identified as <b>Required, Optional</b> or <b>Not Used</b> under <b><i>Edit Characteristics Policy</i></b>.<p />As the wrong account could be identified when certain of these Posting Characteristics are missing, the AlphaLinc transaction must pass a Health Check to see all Required values are present before being the record is passed on.<p />If it fails the Health Check it will appear in this list of <b><i>Not Transferred Postings</i></b>.<p />The normal procedure to clear entries from this list is to identify the source of the missing information (shown in red in the <b>Required</b> column) and to correct the masterfile data.<br />In some situations it may be more appropriate to add the entry directly into the record on the grid.  Normally the latter procedure will only be used when the rules are changed and a transaction has been processed under the old rules.  These changes will not be passed back to the order or any of the master data records.<br /><p />The <b><i>Reprocess Transactions</i></b> button then attempts to resend the transactions through to the General Ledger again.  Any that fail the health check will be added back to the list.  The original entries are removed, resulting in a new set of <b>Process Numbers</b>.<br /><CENTER><IMG src="{YGIF}r.gif" TITLE="r"></CENTER><p />If a field is incorrectly or accidentally changed, use the <b><i>Undo</i></b> button to restore the original data.<br /><CENTER><IMG src="{YGIF}x.gif" TITLE="x"></CENTER><br />
